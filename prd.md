# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
Spring Boot Database Locking Strategy Showcase

## Objective
To create a Spring Boot project that demonstrates various database locking strategies, providing clear examples and explanations for each. The project will serve as a reference for developers to understand and implement appropriate locking mechanisms based on different scenarios.

## Target Audience
- Java/Spring Boot developers
- Backend engineers
- Students and professionals interested in database concurrency and locking

## Key Features
1. **Multiple Locking Strategies**
   - Pessimistic Locking
   - Optimistic Locking
   - Row-level Locking
   - Table-level Locking
   - Application-level Locking (e.g., using Redis)
2. **Scenario-based Demonstrations**
   - Each strategy will be demonstrated with a real-world scenario (e.g., ticket booking, inventory management).
3. **REST API Endpoints**
   - Expose endpoints to trigger and observe locking behavior.
4. **Documentation & Diagrams**
   - Clear documentation and sequence diagrams for each strategy.
5. **Test Cases**
   - Automated tests to showcase race conditions and locking effectiveness.

## Out of Scope
- Production-grade security
- UI frontend (initially)

## Success Criteria
- Each locking strategy is clearly demonstrated and documented.
- Code is clean, modular, and easy to understand.
- Project is easily runnable via Docker or local setup.

## Milestones
1. Project setup and initial documentation
2. Implement Pessimistic Locking scenario
3. Implement Optimistic Locking scenario
4. Add other strategies and scenarios
5. Documentation and test coverage

## Repository Structure (Proposed)
- `/src/main/java` - Source code
- `/src/test/java` - Test cases
- `/docs` - Documentation and diagrams
- `/README.md` - Project overview
- `/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
